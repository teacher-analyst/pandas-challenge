    "Pandas dataframes were created and manipulated to analyse school and standardised test data of a particular Local Government Area (LGA) . Summary dataframes were created of a Local Government Area and of the 15 schools in the LGA. The highest and lowest performing schools in the LGA were determined. Also, scores were organised according to school spending, school size and school type. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the LGA, there are 15 schools and a total of 39,170 students. Of the 15 schools, 7 are Government schools and 8 are Independent. The total budget of the 15 schools is over $24 million. Students in this LGA are performing at standard with an average reading score of 69.9% and a naverage maths score of 70%. There is a high student pass rate in both maths and reading averaging above 80%. The performance of schools was determined by the percentage of students who achieved an overall score greater than 50%. 4 out of 5 of the bottom performing schools are government schools and 3 out of 4 of the top performing schools are independent schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key metrics used to make a judgement about the performance of each school in the LGA are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Average maths score\n",
    "- Average reading score\n",
    "- % Passing Maths: Percentage of students who achieved 50% or higher in a maths test\n",
    "- % Passing Reading: Percentage of students who achieved 50% or higher in a reading test\n",
    "-% Overall Passing: Percentage of students who ahvieved an overall grade   greater than 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "When the key metrics are sorted by school type, independent schools score higher in each metric compared with government schools. The greatest difference is seen in the percentage of students who passed maths and reading; 77% of students at independent schools are achieving an overall passing grade compared with 71% of students at government schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a decreasing trend in the performance of a school as the school size increases. Schools that have less than 1000 students recorded average math scores of 91% compared with an average of 84% for larger schools that have 2000 to 5000 students. There is also a noticiable difference in the percentage students who passed maths and reading, 79% in small schools compared with 70% in larger schools."
